# Core game design
My game is inspired by an endless runner, with diffrent rounds with the difficulty increasing. The story is that you are a refugee and you have to skate your way into britain. each level will be getting closer to final which is a boss battle against mr farage. There will be power ups and upgrades for the skateboard, which will be able to interacted with the buttons on the controller.

# Unique selling points
- game will be unique outlook on the political challenges of the world
- fast paced skating and with boss battle twist

# My Controller
The controller will be based off the nunchuck from the wii. It will be a single handed cntroller with one joystick and buttons underneath for each finger making it universal for left handers or right. This means the controller could be further intergrated with other forms of input such as arrow keys if you want to make a fps.
